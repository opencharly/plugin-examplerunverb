# AGENTS.md — plugin-examplerunverb

Standalone plugin repo for the `examplerunverb` capability
(`verb:examplerunverb`) — the reference host-coupled check verb, a
`kit.CheckVerbProvider` that keeps the live `*Runner`. The plugin is a Go module
at `candy/plugin-examplerunverb/` (module path
`github.com/opencharly/plugin-examplerunverb/candy/plugin-examplerunverb`); the
root `charly.yml` only declares `discover: candy` so the repo is a project and
its candy is scanned.

Canonical files:

- `candy/plugin-examplerunverb/charly.yml` — the `plugin-examplerunverb:` candy
  entity (`plugin:` block, `plan:` check).
- `candy/plugin-examplerunverb/plugin.go` — the `kit.CheckVerbProvider`
  (`NewCheckVerb()` + `NewMeta()` + `RunVerb`).
- `candy/plugin-examplerunverb/schema/examplerunverb.cue` — the self-contained
  `#ExamplerunverbInput`.
- `candy/plugin-examplerunverb/params/cue_types_gen.go` — generated params (do not
  hand-edit).
- `.github/workflows/tag-on-merge.yml` — CalVer tag + `CHANGELOG/` on merge.
- `README.md` — user overview only; never agent guidance.

## Load these skills first (R0)

- `/charly-internals:plugin` — the plugin authoring reference: the `plugin:`
  block, the unified Provider model, the `kit` check-verb contract, the
  per-plugin CUE-schema contract, placement. Load before touching the provider or
  schema.
- `/charly-check:check` — the declarative check-verb surface the `examplerunverb:`
  verb is authored through.
- `/charly-internals:git-workflow` — before any git/PR action.

## Build / validate / test

- `go build ./...` in `candy/plugin-examplerunverb/` — compile the plugin module.
- `go test ./...` in `candy/plugin-examplerunverb/` — the plugin's Go tests.
- `charly box validate` at the repo root — the structural check (the candy +
  `plugin:` block, CUE schema).
- The merge gate is the **org-wide** `charly/pr-validator` (required check
  `validate / validate`, defined in `opencharly/.github`); this repo has **no**
  per-repo candy gate.

## Modify this repo

- Edit the `plugin-examplerunverb:` candy entity, the Go source, and
  `schema/examplerunverb.cue` **together** — the schema is the single source for
  the `params/` struct, so a field change not mirrored in the schema desyncs the
  generated types.
- The verb reads live engine state off the `kit.CheckContext`; keep it a
  `CheckVerbProvider` dispatched via `RunVerb` — that is the property it exists to
  prove.

## Landing

- PR-only. Every change lands through a pull request; the org-required
  `charly/pr-validator` validates the diff and body and arms native auto-merge on
  PASS. Direct pushes to `main` are blocked.
- History lives in `CHANGELOG/` (written by `tag-on-merge` at merge time); the PR
  body IS the changelog.
- The authoritative rulebook is the umbrella `AGENTS.md` in
  `opencharly/opencharly` and `charly/AGENTS.md` in the charly repo. Do not
  restate its rules here.
